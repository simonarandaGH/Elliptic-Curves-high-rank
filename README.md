Some unpublished Elliptic Curves

Always Short form [A,B]. (Karl Weierstrass)

Examples

C[ n,0]  2020343 rank 6

C[-n,0] -3129357 rank 6,  -188588857 rank 7

C[-n^2,1] rank 7,8,9. 

And many others.

Some unpublished Conjectures

1 - The smallest number of digits of any rank r curve is: r*lg(r).

2 - The rank of an elliptic curve is almost always smaller than Omega(Discriminant). The probability of error is less than 5%.
