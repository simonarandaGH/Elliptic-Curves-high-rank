If the curve C[n] , being n even, belongs to the family M (congruent curves) then C[n/2] belongs to the family T with identical rank. The reciprocal is also true.
This has the consequence that:
for n="3305859933" the curve [+n^2, 0] has rank 6. 
Fact verified and unpublished.
In the T-family the smallest value with rank 5 is the half of the smallest even value of rank 5 in the M-family.
