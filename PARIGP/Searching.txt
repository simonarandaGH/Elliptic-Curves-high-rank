Whatever the search method, the result is invariant. 
After getting approximately "O(b)" curves of rank "b", 
a curve of rank "b+1" emerges.
It is a pyramid, a tree. 
Where the number "O(b)" oscillates continuously.
It is random. But not entirely. There is a pyramidal order.  
Observed from infinity it is even a routine order. 
Looked at closely it is desperate.
