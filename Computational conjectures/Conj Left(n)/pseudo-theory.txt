Looking for C[A,B] with a high rank.

PART I. Rank C[A,B]
===================

The function rank C[A,B] is defined exclusively for integer values.
As a function of the type "z=f(x,y)" it would be possible to imagine infinite continuous surfaces that coincide in each concrete integer value. Of all of them there is only one with the smallest global curvature. Isolines of equal rank value are cuts of that surface with a "z constant" plane. 
Forget that: no gradients yet.

If defining a vector of prime numbers and "A" as the product of these, we will have the sequence: vector[] -> A -> [-A,0] -> rank.
The accompanying script is a hybrid search procedure, currently in a highly beta release. One part of it goes round the points with identical rank, while looking for a nearby point of the next higher level. Positioned at a certain point, defined by a vectorstate, it examines the surrounding region in a random-smart way. Trying to find:
1 - a point of higher rank 
2 - a point of equal rank but lower n 
3 - a point of equal rank but higher n
Once a point is located that meets any of these criteria, it displaces to it.
It does not descend to lower level points. Various parameters moderate the random search. This tuning sets the depth of the search to the narrowest possible range that will allow the reaching of the next level. This is a beta version that has produced some results to date. It is a tiny script but it is full of potential. It is released in this repo under an open source license.


PART II
Be L(n) the number of integral points of C[-n,0] with x<0.
==========================================================
Statistically the rank is greater than L(n) 3/5 times. The average difference between L(n) and rank(n) is less than 1. This heuristic has allowed to find (and check) the "smallest" C[-n,0] with rank 6. The PARIGP script used can be found in the repo.

Example curves [-n,0]. Pleft: integral points whit x<0, L(n).
-17 rank=2 #PLeft=2
-56 rank=2 #PLeft=1
-65 rank=2 #PLeft=2
-77 rank=2 #PLeft=1
-82 rank=3 #PLeft=3
-90 rank=2 #PLeft=2
-97 rank=2 #PLeft=2
-38412 rank=4 #PLeft=7
-49932 rank=4 #PLeft=10
-685377 rank=5 #PLeft=10
